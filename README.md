# Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;The project is a 3D game with first-person Pac-Man gameplay. The player will take on the role of a traveller who mistakenly enters a fairytale world by touching a teacup. You need to collect all the sugar cubes in the scene and drop them into the teacups while escaping from the monsters. There are two main levels(cups)

# 1. Game Design Ideas
## 1.1 Source of Inspiration
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of gameplay, this game is inspired by the 2D game "Pac-Man". The main gameplay is to collect all the sugar beans to complete the game, and we have upgraded and optimised it. We have upgraded and optimised the game, and the transformation between 2D and 3D games can often make a big difference in the gaming experience. For example, a Pac-Man game can be transformed into a more intense and exciting game.  
&emsp;&emsp;In terms of background setting, the story is set up to be reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz, a quirky fairy tale, and so derives its own imaginative creation of the story world under the major theme of fairy tales.
## 1.2 Background Setting
- Player Settings  
&emsp;&emsp;Eric, the main character of the game played by the player, finds a dining table full of tea sets. But two of the teacups were flooded with a different sight, completely different from reality. It's as if it's drawing him/her forward and closer all the time. He was just about to touch them lightly with his fingers when he was sucked in all at once. At that moment, a voice told him to collect all the sugar cubes scattered in the scene in order to get out of this world.
- Level 1  
&emsp;&emsp;The first level is set in a forest maze inhabited by bell cats. The three bell cats spread lots of sugar cubes on the paths and then patrol along the high walls of the maze to prevent any foreign intruders from stealing their sugar cubes, and once they are found, they will be caught by the bell cats and never be able to get out of this forest maze. The bell cats will follow your scent to find you, while the huge bells on their bodies will sound to signal their arrival. Collect the scattered sugar cubes and escape before they catch you!
- Level 2  
&emsp;&emsp;Passing through the forest labyrinth inhabited by the bell cat, you will see the castle in front of you. The second level is set in a castle guarded by Chess Knights. The Chess Knights appear to be standing guard, but when an intruder arrives, the five knights enchanted by the lord of the castle will activate. When the knights are out of the player's reach, they will glide quickly and step behind the intruder to catch him. Players will have to spot the enchanted knights through keen insight and evade their pursuit by placing the sugar cubes in the cups.
- Monster Image Design  
&emsp;&emsp;The bell cats.They are more cartoonish but have sharp fangs and claws, and live in a maze of forests covered in sugar cubes; they are usually mild-mannered and have a very quick pace, but become vicious once they find that someone has entered their territory and tried to touch the sugar cubes.   
&emsp;&emsp;Chess guards, based on chess, black and white, dressed in armour, with chess pieces as their bodies and swords in their hands, guarding the Square Sugar Castle, spending their days in a standing position, but in fact moving sensitively, moving quickly out of sight of intruders.
- Main game props
&emsp;&emsp;Square Sugar, a prop that Eric needs to collect. When all are collected and put into the teacups, the sugar cubes will activate a mysterious power to send Eric back to the original world, back to the table where the teacups were placed.
&emsp;&emsp;View Candy is a prop that needs to be collected just like the Candy Cube. The difference is that the View Candy has the effect of monitoring the real-time location at a glance, and one capsule lasts for 20s.
## 1.3 Main Gameplay
&emsp;&emsp;The main character of the game is controlled using the four basic control keys ASDW, with the mouse to achieve the character's running and change direction.
